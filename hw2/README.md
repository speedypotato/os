PLEASE GO OVER REPORT and tidy it up. WOuld help if can do so and print it before class.
Also if no one objects, lets sign up to meet with grader after class?

2/22

The following four functions need be completed:

Nick:   round robin  
kevin:  shortest job  
Eric:   highest priority (non-preemptive)  
Bryan:  highest priority w/aging (non-preemptive)  

Rob:    write up

See below for an explanation of the functions, in addition to the other files

```C++
struct AlgoRet
{
    int jobsCompleted;
    int lastCompletionTime;
};
/*
    First 2 parameters are input.
    The job[] will be sorted by arrival time, with all arrival times distinct.
    
    In addition to the return value, the last two arrays are outputs.
    
    Index of job is its id, job[i] has an id of i, and corresponds to stats[i].
    The stats each algorithm stores for each job is the time of its first slice, and completion time.
    Jobs that don't get serviced can be left alone; the array is initialized before hand.
    
    gantt[q] is the id+'A' of the job that run for slice q, or if cpu was idle '.'.
    
    See the implementation of fcfs in main.cpp for an example.
*/
AlgoRet round_robin       (const Job* job, int njobs, PerJobStats* stats, char* gantt);

AlgoRet sjf               (const Job* job, int njobs, PerJobStats* stats, char* gantt);
AlgoRet hpf_non_preemptive(const Job* job, int njobs, PerJobStats* stats, char* gantt);
AlgoRet hpf_aging_non_preemptive(const Job* job, int njobs, PerJobStats* stats, char* gantt);
/*
  I think the last three are all very similar, and could all be done in a similar way to
  the preemptive template function. But with many hands a person can do a single one.
*/
```
