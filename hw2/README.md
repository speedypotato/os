```C++

};
/*
    First 2 parameters are input.
    The job[] will be sorted by arrival time, with all arrival times distinct.
    
    In addition to the return value, the last two arrays are outputs.
    
    Index of job is its id, job[i] has an id of i, and corresponds to stats[i].
    The stats each algorithm stores for each job is the time of its first slice, and completion time.
    Jobs that don't get serviced can be left alone; the array is initialized before hand.
    
    gantt[q] is the id+'A' of the job that run for slice q, or if cpu was idle '.'.
    
    See the implementation of fcfs in main.cpp for an example.

  I think the last three are all very similar, and could all be done in a similar way to
  the preemptive template function. But with many hands a person can do a single one.
