    (Jonathan):
	To make it easy, you don't have to touch the stats array in your algo impls
	if the corresponding job is not serviced, because the whole stats is memset to 0 before hand.
    Also, all your algorithm needs to store is the service begin and completion time pair
	for each job that gets serviced. Turnaround, wait, and response times are then calculated
    and printed on the same line after the algorithm completes.

    Since the range of priorities and burst span is small, a priority queue based on an array map
    could be neato. Could use bit scan forward to skip to occupied slots

    (Jonathan)
    See preemptive<CmpFun, InitFin> in main.cpp
    for explanation of these Functors.

    Here is something neat I figured out for aging variants of HPF
    which turns them into regular HPF:

    For this explanation, convention is larger priority values are
    more important. A jobs priority increases every 5 slices.
    Let q = current slice. To determine if job a is more important relative to job b
    in the queue, do:
        a.priority*5 + (q-a.arrival) > b.priority*5 + (q-b.arrival)
    Note how the q's cancel, and left with a constant value once inserted into the queue.
    But for assignment, convention is lower priority values more important, so store:

    job.priority*5 + arrival
